The mobile framework is a collection of utilities, which we found to be repeated across multiple apps. In order to bundle those features together, we are hoping to reduce the amount of time we need to keep multiple apps up to date and also share these tools with the community, hopefully helping others to work on the actual ideas instead of reinventing the wheel.

## The framework has the following features implemented: ##

* Caching assets locally (downloading items in the background)
* Custom URL protocol to allow UIWebView to directly load assets from cache, without any additional overhead
* iBeacon ranging

Features to be added in the future:
* Custom Logging service
* Route calculation for indoor wayfinding
* Support for Apple Maps Indoor positioning
